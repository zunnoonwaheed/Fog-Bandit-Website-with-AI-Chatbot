# Fog Bandit Jewellery Landing Page

**Current release: V2 — jewellery-specific PAS landing page with Fog Bandit video, sticky CTA, popup CTA, responsive mobile/desktop layout, and Calendly booking path.**

V2 jewellery-store landing page for Fog Bandit ANZ, built around PAS and shortened for paid-traffic conversion.

## V2 conversion structure
1. Thin top CTA banner
2. Jewellery-specific hero
3. Problem + response-gap visual
4. Fog Bandit jewellery video as the solution centerpiece
5. Three-step mechanism
6. Compact day/night use cases
7. Jewellery proof/testimonial
8. Four purchase-blocking FAQs
9. Calendly security assessment booking
10. Responsive sticky CTA + delayed/exit-intent assessment popup

## Responsive behaviour
- Desktop: full navigation, bottom sticky assessment bar after the hero, exit-intent or ~56% scroll popup.
- Mobile: stacked content, full-width bottom CTA, popup at ~66% scroll, no exit-intent dependency.
- Sticky CTA hides over the hero and assessment form to avoid CTA collisions.

## Local preview
```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```
Open `http://localhost:4173/domain/landingPage/`.
